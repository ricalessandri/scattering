# Simulated scattering patterns

Generate scattering curves as described in [JACS 139 (10), 3697-3705](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jacs.6b11717).
The `ipython` notebook reproduces the scattering curves shown in Fig. 4 of [JACS 139 (10), 3697-3705](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jacs.6b11717).
